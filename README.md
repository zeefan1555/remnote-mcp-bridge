# RemNote Automation Bridge

A RemNote plugin that exposes your RemNote knowledge base to external automation clients over a local WebSocket
bridge. It is the shared RemNote endpoint for the `remnote-mcp-server` package:

- **[RemNote MCP Server](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)** for MCP-compatible AI assistants
- **`remnote-mcp-stdio` bundled in remnote-mcp-server** for stdio-only MCP clients
- **`remnote-cli` bundled in remnote-mcp-server** for scripts, local agents, and CLI-first workflows

> **Connection issue? Check the RemNote bridge plugin and server versions first.** Use the official
> **MCP/OpenClaw Automation Bridge** by Robert Spiegel in RemNote, and run a compatible `remnote-mcp-server` on the same
> `0.x` minor line. Wrong plugin flavors or mismatched versions can disconnect with a `1008` compatibility message.
> If Marketplace and npm releases are temporarily out of
> sync, pin the matching server package or run matching bridge/server checkouts from source. Start with the
> [version compatibility guide](docs/guides/bridge-consumer-version-compatibility.md),
> [Marketplace plugin install guide](docs/guides/install-plugin-via-marketplace-beginner.md),
> [local plugin guide](docs/guides/development-run-plugin-locally.md), and
> [server installation guide](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/guides/installation.md).
> After setup, see the
> [agent validation prompts](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/agent-validation-prompts/README.md)
> to verify that your chosen AI agent can use the installed RemNote MCP tools end to end.
> If the guides do not resolve your problem, [open an issue](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-bridge/issues)
> with the relevant versions, setup path, observed behavior, and exact error/status message.

## Integration Paths

This project is a bridge layer with two consumer paths, both served by the `remnote-mcp-server` package:

1. **MCP Server path:**
   - **RemNote Automation Bridge** (this project): RemNote plugin exposing RemNote API via WebSocket
   - **[RemNote MCP Server](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)**: companion server exposing MCP tools to AI
     assistants
   - **`remnote-mcp-stdio`**: optional stdio-to-HTTP proxy for MCP clients that cannot use Streamable HTTP directly
   - Demo: **[MCP Server Demo and Screenshots](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/demo.md)** · **[Advanced Use Cases](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/advanced-use-cases.md)**
2. **CLI app path (e.g. for OpenClaw):**
   - This bridge plugin remains the RemNote endpoint
   - **[RemNote MCP Server](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)**: the single local server connected to the
     bridge
   - **`remnote-cli`**: command-line MCP client bundled in `remnote-mcp-server` for OpenClaw and other agentic workflows
   - Demo: **[RemNote CLI Demo and Screenshots](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/demo.md#remnote-cli)**

**For both paths the required server component is `remnote-mcp-server`; `remnote-mcp-stdio` and `remnote-cli` are
optional proxy/client commands for that server.**

| Companion             | Best fit                                                   | Typical client                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `remnote-mcp-server`  | Conversational AI tool use via MCP over HTTP               | Claude Code, ChatGPT Apps, Claude Cowork, other MCP clients |
| `remnote-mcp-stdio`   | Stdio-only MCP clients needing a local proxy               | Codex stdio setups, MCP clients without HTTP transport      |
| `remnote-cli`         | Lightweight local automation and command-driven workflows  | OpenClaw, coding harnesses, shell scripts, local agents     |

**Version compatibility warning (`0.x` semver):** install a `remnote-mcp-server` version that matches your installed
bridge plugin version (prefer the same minor line). See the [Bridge / Consumer Version Compatibility Guide](docs/guides/bridge-consumer-version-compatibility.md).

**MCP protocol note:** `protocolVersion` values such as `2025-11-25` are MCP protocol negotiation versions from the MCP
SDK, not bridge/server package versions. Current `remnote-mcp-server` builds support `2025-11-25`; a Claude Desktop
initialize timeout usually points to configuration or reachability rather than that version number. For local Claude
Desktop, prefer the
[Local MCPB guide](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/guides/configuration-claude-desktop-local-mcpb.md).

## Why This Bridge Exists

RemNote plugins cannot be called directly by external automation clients. This bridge provides one stable local
connection point that the server package can target:

- **MCP path** when you want AI assistants to call RemNote tools through [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- **CLI path** when you want shell commands, scripts, or local agents to access the same bridge surface

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Create Notes & Flashcards** - Create simple notes, hierarchical markdown trees, or RemNote-native flashcards
- **Search Knowledge Base** - Full-text search across your Rems, plus tag-based search with ancestor context
- **Read Notes** - Read notes with tags plus markdown or structured child content for follow-up navigation
- **Update Notes** - Rename notes, insert or replace hierarchical content, and manage tags by exact Rem ID
- **Daily Journal** - Append entries to today's daily document, including hierarchical markdown content and optional exact tag Rem IDs

### Plugin Features

- **Sidebar Control Panel** - Monitor Automation Bridge connection status, statistics, and action history
- **Auto-tagging** - Automatically tag notes created via Automation Bridge actions with an exact tag Rem ID
- **Session Statistics** - Track created/updated/journal entries/searches
- **Action History** - View last 10 bridge actions with timestamps
- **Configurable Settings** - Customize behavior through RemNote settings
- **Real-time Status** - Live connection status indicator in sidebar panel

## Data Privacy

The bridge itself only talks to a local `remnote-mcp-server` WebSocket endpoint (default:
`ws://127.0.0.1:3002`). Connection direction is **Bridge Plugin -> remnote-mcp-server**, not the other way around.

Supported data flows:

- **MCP path:** `RemNote ↔ Bridge Plugin ↔ Local MCP Server ↔ AI Assistant`
- **CLI path:** `RemNote ↔ Bridge Plugin ↔ Local MCP Server ↔ RemNote CLI ↔ Local Agents`

What this means in practice:

- **The plugin itself does NOT send data to external servers**
- Any external sharing happens in the chosen MCP client or local automation path, not in the bridge plugin itself
- For the MCP path, your AI assistant only sees the data forwarded through your local MCP server setup
- For the CLI path, data stays within your local MCP-server/CLI workflow unless your own scripts or agents forward it

Why this works that way: RemNote plugins do not have a hosted backend API, so the bridge must connect outward from the
RemNote frontend plugin to the local server process. See the [Connection Lifecycle
Guide](docs/guides/connection-lifecycle.md) and the official RemNote [Backend Plugins](https://plugins.remnote.com/advanced/backend_plugins)
page.

For MCP-path security details, see the [RemNote MCP Server Security
Model](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/architecture.md#security-model) documentation.

## Installation

### 1. Install the RemNote Plugin (This Repository)

Choose the install path that fits your use case:

- **Recommended for most users (marketplace install):**
  - [Install the Plugin via RemNote Marketplace (Beginner Guide)](docs/guides/install-plugin-via-marketplace-beginner.md)
- **For developers / local plugin testing from source:**
  - [Run The Plugin Locally (Beginner Guide)](docs/guides/development-run-plugin-locally.md)

After plugin installation (either path), the bridge starts automatically when the plugin activates in RemNote. You can
optionally open the control panel to inspect status and logs:

- Look for the **Automation Bridge** icon in RemNote's right sidebar toolbar
- Click the icon to open the Automation Bridge panel

If the panel disconnects immediately or shows a `1008` compatibility message, verify that RemNote has the official
**MCP/OpenClaw Automation Bridge** plugin installed and not a similarly named marketplace fork or older flavor.

The sidebar panel is no longer required to create the connection. It is a monitoring and manual-control surface for the
background bridge runtime.

For the full connection/reconnect behavior, see the [Connection Lifecycle Guide](docs/guides/connection-lifecycle.md).

- [Execute Bridge Commands — Screenshot Walkthrough](docs/guides/development-execute-bridge-commands-screenshots.md)

### 2. Choose Your Companion Path

**Important:** the plugin alone is not sufficient. You need the MCP server. The CLI is an additional client for local
automation workflows.

#### MCP server path

Use **[RemNote MCP Server](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)** when you want MCP-compatible AI assistants
to call RemNote tools.

```bash
npm install -g remnote-mcp-server
```

See the **[RemNote MCP Server repository](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)** for installation,
configuration, and troubleshooting.

#### CLI path

Use the `remnote-cli` command bundled with **[RemNote MCP Server](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)**
when you want shell commands, OpenClaw, or other local agent workflows to access the same bridge.

```bash
npm uninstall -g remnote-cli
npm install -g remnote-mcp-server
```

See the **[RemNote MCP Server repository](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)** for installation, command
reference, and workflow examples.

> **Version compatibility (important):** before installing/upgrading the MCP server package, check the
> [Bridge / Consumer Version Compatibility Guide](docs/guides/bridge-consumer-version-compatibility.md).

### Recommended Startup Order

1. Start the local server process first:
   - `remnote-mcp-server`
2. Open RemNote.
3. Wait for the bridge to connect in the background, or open the Automation Bridge panel if you want to confirm
   status.
4. Only then start using your MCP client or `remnote-cli` commands.

If RemNote was already open before the local server process started, the bridge keeps retrying automatically. You can
click **Reconnect Now** for an immediate retry. The sidebar also shows whether the bridge is still in the quick retry
window or already in standby background retry mode.

For exact retry/backoff behavior and wake-up triggers such as opening the bridge panel, RemNote activity, or
visibility/online events, see the [Connection Lifecycle
Guide](docs/guides/connection-lifecycle.md).

## Important Limitations

### Single Connection

The system enforces a **single RemNote plugin connection** to one local server process at a time. This means:

- The bridge plugin connects to one local WebSocket endpoint
- `remnote-mcp-server` is the supported local WebSocket companion for both MCP clients and `remnote-cli`
- Multiple AI assistants and CLI commands can share that one bridge connection through the MCP server's own
  multi-client transport
- This is a RemNote plugin limitation, not a limitation specific to the MCP server or CLI

For technical details about multi-agent support and connection architecture, see the **[RemNote MCP Server
documentation](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server#multi-agent-support)**.

## Configuration

Access plugin settings in RemNote via **Settings > Plugins > Automation Bridge (OpenClaw, CLI, MCP...)**:

| Setting                  | Description                                                          | Default               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Accept write operations  | Allow write actions (`create_note`, `update_note`, `append_journal`)       | `true`                |
| Accept replace operation | Allow destructive child replacement actions                               | `false`               |
| Auto-tag created notes   | Add a tag to notes created via bridge actions                              | `true`                |
| Auto-tag Rem ID          | Exact tag Rem ID for auto-tagged created notes; tag names are not accepted | ``                    |
| Journal entry prefix     | Optional prefix for journal entries                                        | ``                    |
| Add timestamp to journal | Include time in journal entries                                            | `true`                |
| WebSocket server URL     | Automation bridge server connection URL                                    | `ws://127.0.0.1:3002` |
| Default parent Rem ID    | Parent for new notes (empty = root)                                        | ``                    |

## Bridge Action Surface

The bridge exposes this shared action surface to companion clients. The MCP server maps these actions to MCP tools, and
the CLI maps them to commands:

| Action             | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create_note`      | Create notes, markdown trees, or flashcards with optional exact tag Rem IDs |
| `search`           | Search the knowledge base with query, filters, and tag ID/name metadata     |
| `search_by_tag`    | Search by exact tag Rem ID with ancestor context and content controls       |
| `read_note`        | Read a note's metadata, tags, and content in markdown or structured form    |
| `update_note`      | Update note title                                                           |
| `insert_children`  | Insert child Rems at deterministic positions                                |
| `replace_children` | Replace direct content children while preserving parent metadata             |
| `update_tags`      | Add or remove tags by exact tag Rem ID                                      |
| `append_journal`   | Add markdown content to today's daily document with optional tag Rem IDs    |
| `read_table`       | Read Advanced Table columns, rows, and typed property metadata              |
| `get_status`       | Check connection status                                                     |

## Usage

### Opening the Control Panel

The bridge control panel is accessible via the right sidebar:

1. Locate the **Automation Bridge icon** in RemNote's right sidebar toolbar
2. Click the icon to open the control panel in the sidebar
3. The panel displays:
   - **Connection Status** - Current WebSocket connection state
   - **Session Statistics** - Counts of created notes, updates, journal entries, and searches
   - **Action History** - Last 10 bridge actions with timestamps
   - **Recent Logs** - Real-time activity log
4. The panel remains visible while you navigate RemNote (non-blocking)
5. Click the icon again to close the panel

The connection logic runs in the background even when the panel is closed.

The sidebar panel provides persistent monitoring of bridge connection and activity while you work in RemNote.

### Example Interactions

Once everything is connected, you can use either access path:

- **MCP path:** _Create a note about the meeting we just had_
- **MCP path:** _Find all my notes tagged with "Ideas" and summarize them_
- **CLI path:** `remnote-cli search "AI coding" --text`
- **CLI path:** `remnote-cli create "Reading List" --content-file /tmp/reading-list.md --text`

## Architecture

```text
MCP clients / AI assistants -> MCP Server (HTTP) -> WebSocket :3002 -> RemNote Plugin (this repo) -> RemNote SDK
stdio MCP clients -> remnote-mcp-stdio -> MCP Server (HTTP) -> WebSocket :3002 -> RemNote Plugin -> RemNote SDK
CLI commands / local agents -> RemNote CLI -> MCP Server (HTTP) -> WebSocket :3002 -> RemNote Plugin -> RemNote SDK
```

**Component roles:**

- **RemNote Automation Bridge** (this repository) - RemNote plugin that executes bridge actions via the RemNote SDK
- **RemNote MCP Server** ([separate repository](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server)) - Exposes bridge
  actions to MCP-compatible AI assistants and CLI clients
- **remnote-mcp-stdio** (bundled in the server package) - Proxies stdio MCP clients to the local MCP server
- **remnote-cli** (bundled in the server package) - Exposes the same bridge actions as local commands by calling the
  MCP server

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Issues

**Plugin won't connect:**

1. **Verify plugin settings in RemNote:**
   - WebSocket URL: `ws://127.0.0.1:3002` (default)
   - Check that MCP Server is running
2. **Check plugin console (RemNote Developer Tools):**

   ```text
   Cmd+Option+I (macOS)
   Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux)
   ```

3. **Restart RemNote** after changing settings

4. **If using RemNote in a Chromium-based browser, not the desktop app:** Chrome 147+ can block the marketplace plugin
   iframe from connecting to `ws://127.0.0.1:3002`; see
   [Chrome Local Network Access troubleshooting](docs/guides/connection-lifecycle.md#chrome-local-network-access-can-block-browser-websockets).

**"Invalid event setCustomCSS" errors:**

- Currently observed in hot-reload development runs (`npm run dev` or `./run-dev.sh`)
- Appears non-blocking (bridge functionality continues after dismissing the overlay)
- For production-style local verification, use `./run-prod-build.sh` (no hot reload)
- Treat this as current observed behavior, not a permanent guarantee across SDK/runtime updates

**Notes not appearing:**

- Check if a default parent ID is set (might be creating under a specific Rem)
- Verify the auto-tag setting isn't filtering your view

### Server Issues

For server-related troubleshooting (installation, configuration, port conflicts, MCP tools not appearing in
AI assistant), see the **[RemNote MCP Server
documentation](https://github.com/robert7/remnote-mcp-server#troubleshooting)**.
