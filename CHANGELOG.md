# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add real RemNote alias writes to `create_note` and `update_note`, with whitespace normalization, exact additive and
  removal operations, idempotency, Unicode preservation, and protection against ambiguous or contradictory requests.

### Changed

- Define synchronized minor releases as the compatibility boundary for new bridge/server protocol features while
  preserving patch-level wire compatibility.

### Fixed

- Fix `replace_children` so destructive child replacement preserves parent aliases, properties, tags, document status,
  title, and Rem ID.

### Removed

- Remove the redundant bridge capability list and `media.images.v1` negotiation; matching bridge/server minor versions
  now provide the complete protocol contract.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Add opt-in ordered image metadata to `read_note` via `includeMediaMetadata`, advertise the `media.images.v1`
  capability, and add the capability-gated `get_media_locator` action for resolving stable media IDs to decoded,
  validated RemNote-managed local filename tokens. Contributed by Charles (`@charleseze356`).
- Add scoped search in the `search` action via `parentRemId`, including scope-safe cursor snapshots and pagination.
  Contributed by Twb06.
- Add `set_property` bridge action for exact-ID tag/table property writes, including text, Rem-reference/select-option,
  and clear value payloads.
- Add exact Rem reference tokens via `[[id:<remId>]]` in markdown-capable write fields, avoiding name-lookup stubs when
  linking to existing Rems by ID.
- Add an agent-agnostic maintainer workflow for evaluating, adapting, verifying, and merging single-repo or paired
  bridge/server pull requests with contributor attribution.

### Changed

- Clarify pull request adoption workflow guidance for localizing live integration failures across MCP/server and
  bridge/RemNote boundaries before merge decisions.
- Validate the bridge on Node.js `22.13.0` and `24`.

### Fixed

- Stop scoped search subtree validation early when a cyclic parent chain is encountered.
- Fix `insert_children` transaction handling so live RemNote writes return plain result data instead of SDK Rem objects,
  preventing transaction completion timeouts.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Add document-status support for Rems: `set_document_status` previews or applies document status while preserving Rem
  IDs, children, tags, parents, and concept/card metadata; `create_note` can mark the created title/root Rem as a
  document with `asDocument`.
- Add discovery-oriented hierarchy APIs: parent-first `ancestors` via `ancestorDepth`, compact `view` output control,
  direct-child listing, and dry-run-first note moving.
- Add cursor paging metadata to `search` and `search_by_tag`, including `hasMore`, `nextCursor`, and explicit
  snapshot-cap truncation reporting.
- Preserve inline Rem references in `search`, `search_by_tag`, and `read_note` output by rendering resolvable
  references as `[[Target Title]]` and exposing `inlineRefs` metadata with exact target Rem IDs.
- Add `search_by_tag.resultMode` with direct tagged Rem results and `matchedRems` metadata for context results.

### Changed

- Classify Rems that are both documents and concepts as `document` in bridge search/read outputs while keeping card
  metadata such as `cardDirection` separate.
- Run lint, format, release build validation, and production dist build helpers through local package binaries instead
  of `npx`.

### Fixed

- Fix dry-run `move_note` previews so `ancestorsAfterTruncated` is reported when the proposed new parent has hidden
  ancestors at the requested depth.
- Fix `run-prod-build.sh` to resolve Webpack from `node_modules/.bin` when run outside npm script PATH setup.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Changed tag metadata to return exact tag Rem IDs plus names as `{ tagRemId, name }` objects.
- Changed `search_by_tag` to use exact tag Rem IDs through `tagRemId`, avoiding ambiguous tag name or alias lookup.
- Split bridge write actions so `update_note` handles title updates, `insert_children` handles ordered child creation,
  `replace_children` handles gated destructive child replacement, and `update_tags` mutates tags by exact Rem ID.
- Changed note creation, journal appends, and automatic bridge-created note tagging to use exact tag Rem IDs instead of
  tag names.
  - `create_note` now accepts `tagRemIds` instead of `tags`.
  - `append_journal` now accepts optional `tagRemIds`.
  - Plugin setting `autoTag` was replaced by `autoTagRemId`; users who configured `autoTag` must manually set the new
    `autoTagRemId` field to the desired tag Rem ID.
- Improved bridge disconnect diagnostics for incompatible RemNote marketplace plugins by naming the official
  `MCP/OpenClaw Automation Bridge` plugin in logs and connection UI hints.
- Expanded setup and troubleshooting documentation for official bridge plugin installs, compatible
  `remnote-mcp-server` versions, local MCP protocol/version terminology, the bundled `remnote-mcp-stdio` proxy, and
  end-user validation guidance.

### Fixed

- Hardened bridge write validation so malformed direct bridge payloads cannot clear children, insert at invalid
  positions, or mutate tags from non-array tag ID inputs.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- Added local `remnote-mcp-bridge` executable link/unlink workflows for serving the production `dist/` bundle.
- Documented Chrome/Chromium Local Network Access WebSocket blocking symptoms and workarounds for browser-based
  RemNote users, with thanks to @awreccan for reporting and helping analyze the issue.
- Updated architecture and connection docs for the consolidated `remnote-mcp-server` package, including bundled
  `remnote-cli` command guidance.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added optional `tags` metadata to `search`, `search_by_tag`, and `read_note`, including structured child nodes
  when `includeContent: "structured"` is used.

### Changed

- Corrected the Developer Console debugging guides to identify the working `localhost:8080` plugin runtime window.

### Fixed

- Fix reverse tag readback on `read_note` and plain `search` by using the live-validated `getTagRems()` SDK method.
- Simplify tag-read diagnostics to concise warnings focused on `getTagRems()` failures and unresolved tag results.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Updated the bridge development toolchain to current major package lines, including Vitest 4, ESLint 10,
  TypeScript 6, Tailwind 4, and newer Webpack 5 companion packages.
- Declared build-time dependencies explicitly (`@eslint/js`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`, and `glob`) so local installs
  remain reproducible with newer npm toolchains.
- Kept `react` and `react-dom` on 17.x because `@remnote/plugin-sdk@0.0.46` still declares React 17 peer
  compatibility.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Added bridge support for `read_table`, including Advanced Table lookup by Rem ID or exact title, pagination, and
  column filtering.

### Changed

- Updated `read_table` bridge payloads to require exactly one explicit identifier: `tableRemId` or `tableTitle`.
- Tightened the sidebar connection card to show bridge version, optional `dev` install marker, and connected
  companion identity/version with less explanatory text while keeping a brief connection-direction hint when
  disconnected.

### Fixed

- Fixed Recent Actions expansion so expanded rows stay attached to the correct history entry as new actions arrive.
- Improved `read_table` title lookup for Advanced Tables nested under wrapper/container rems.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Added interactive history entries: expandable child items view, hover actions panel with copy-reference button, and
  click-to-open behavior on titles (thanks to @Twb06).

### Changed

- Raised the local tooling baseline to Node 20.19.0 for consistent package metadata and developer environment checks.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Added a plugin-level bridge runtime that starts on plugin activation, so the bridge can connect even when the
  sidebar panel is never opened.
- Added indefinite standby reconnect behavior after the initial retry burst, plus reconnect nudges on RemNote
  activity, bridge-panel opening, tab visibility regain, and browser `online` events.

### Changed

- The sidebar panel is now a monitoring and manual-control UI over the background runtime rather than the owner of the
  connection.
- Improved the sidebar connection UI to show retry phase, next scheduled retry, last disconnect context, and clearer
  reconnect guidance when the companion process is unavailable.
- Clarified in the bridge UI that the WebSocket connection is initiated by the RemNote bridge plugin toward the local
  companion app, not vice versa.

### Fixed

- Fixed sidebar state sync after late panel opening by bridging snapshot updates and control commands across the
  plugin activation context and the widget UI context through session-storage-based IPC.
- Fixed standby wake-up retries so meaningful RemNote activity and opening the bridge panel restart the fast retry
  window with cooldown protection instead of doing only one isolated retry attempt.

### Documentation

- Updated `README.md` and setup guides to reflect the new automatic background startup and standby reconnect behavior.
- Documented that the sidebar panel is optional for connection setup and remains available for status and manual
  `Reconnect`.
- Added a focused connection lifecycle guide covering startup order, burst vs. standby retry behavior, and what can
  trigger faster reconnects.
- Documented why the bridge connects outward from RemNote, including a link to RemNote's official backend-plugin
  limitation docs.
- Clarified that panel-open and in-app RemNote activity are the main faster-retry triggers, rather than relying only
  on raw window focus.
- Reframed `README.md` around two first-class companion paths, giving `remnote-mcp-server` and `remnote-cli` equal
  weight in the overview, privacy, installation, and architecture sections.
- Added connected-state and burst-retry screenshots to the connection lifecycle guide.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Unified simple note and markdown tree creation into a single `create_note` action.
  - Supports simple note creation (`title` only), hierarchical markdown import under a parent (`title` + `content`), and direct markdown import (`content` only).
  - Flashcards can be created using RemNote markdown syntax (e.g., `::`, `;;`, `>>`) within the `content`.
- Added support for hierarchical markdown trees in `update_note` (`appendContent`, `replaceContent`) and `append_journal` (`content`).
- Fixed an issue where structural markdown elements (headers, ordered lists) on the first line of content were not being parsed correctly by the RemNote SDK. Implemented a "Dummy Root Strategy" using a plain text root to ensure robust hierarchical parsing for all markdown structures.

### Changed

- Standardized mutating actions (`createNote`, `updateNote`, `appendJournal`) to return plural response format `{ remIds, titles }`.
- Refined tag application rules with hierarchical markdown: tags are only applied to the created root or top-level Rems, not to all nested descendants.
- Aligned bridge docs/tests with the unified `create_note` contract and added top-level content-only create coverage.

### Documentation

- Clarified the required startup order in `README.md` and setup guides, including that the right-sidebar Automation
  Bridge panel must be opened to mount the bridge runtime and start connection attempts.
- Documented the manual `Reconnect` fallback after automatic retry exhaustion.

### Attribution

- Most of the cross-repo `create_note` / markdown-tree work in this release was implemented by @Twb06.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Added bridge write policy settings:
  - `Accept write operations` (default `true`)
  - `Accept replace operation` (default `false`)
- Added `update_note` `replaceContent` support for direct-child replacement.
- Added explicit replace semantics for empty-string payloads: `replaceContent: ""` clears all direct children.

### Changed

- `update_note` now rejects mixed append+replace payloads in one request.
- `update_note` is fully blocked when write operations are disabled by bridge settings.
- `get_status` now reports `acceptWriteOperations` and `acceptReplaceOperation` policy flags.
- Default auto-tag name changed from `"MCP"` to empty string (`""`).
- Settings keys migrated from `mcp-*` namespace to `automation-bridge-*`.
- Bridge UI/log wording now prefers "Automation Bridge" terminology.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- `remnote_read_note` now accepts `includeContent: "structured"` and returns `contentStructured` child trees (with
  rem IDs/headlines) for ID-first hierarchy navigation.
- Bridge widget request typing now allows `read_note` `includeContent` mode `"structured"` in addition to
  `"none"`/`"markdown"`.
- Updated search/read contract docs to reflect structured content support parity for `read_note`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `read_note` include-content validation to stop rejecting `"structured"` mode.
- Added unit coverage for structured `read_note` output and unsupported-mode validation.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Fixed bridge widget startup across RemNote SDK/runtime variants by resolving tracker hooks compatibly between
  `useTrackerPlugin` and `useTracker`, with a safe fallback path.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- Upgraded `@remnote/plugin-sdk` from locked `0.0.14` to pinned `0.0.46`, including bridge-side API compatibility updates (`PluginRem`, `useTrackerPlugin`).
- Clarified `setCustomCSS` troubleshooting guidance: issue is observed in hot-reload development runs (`npm run dev` / `./run-dev.sh`), while `./run-prod-build.sh` is the recommended production-style local validation path.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Bridge now sends a `hello` version handshake on WebSocket connect, enabling companion clients to detect
  bridge/client minor-version mismatches.
- Added `search_by_tag` bridge action with content-rendering controls (`includeContent`, `depth`, `childLimit`,
  `maxContentLength`).
- `remnote_search` and `remnote_read_note` now return richer note metadata:
  `headline`, `aliases`, `parentRemId`, `parentTitle`, and `contentProperties`.
- `remnote_search` now supports `includeContent: "structured"` and returns nested `contentStructured` output for
  follow-up navigation.
- Added `run-prod-build.sh` to build and serve a production `dist/` bundle locally without creating `PluginZip.zip`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `includeContent` changed from boolean to string mode (`'none' | 'markdown'`; search also supports
  `'structured'`).
- **BREAKING**: `remnote_read_note` no longer returns `children`; `content` now contains rendered markdown subtree
  output, and `detail` is removed from search/read payloads.
- Default rendering/query limits were updated: `read` depth now defaults to 5; search/read now expose
  `childLimit` and `maxContentLength` defaults.
- Search ranking/selection behavior was refined: grouped ordering by rem type, oversample + dedupe by `remId`, and
  trim back to requested limit for more stable unique result counts.

### Fixed

- Invalid `includeContent` values now produce explicit errors instead of silently omitting content.
- Markdown/structured rendering now filters internal property/powerup rows and trims trailing empty leaf nodes.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-21

### Enhanced

- `remnote_search` and `remnote_read_note` now render richer titles from RemNote rich text (references, global names,
  media placeholders, LaTeX/annotation text, and markdown formatting for inline emphasis/links).
- Added structured result metadata for retrieval workflows:
  - `detail` (back/descriptor text)
  - `remType` (`document`, `dailyDocument`, `concept`, `descriptor`, `portal`, `text`)
  - `cardDirection` (`forward`, `reverse`, `bidirectional`; omitted when not applicable)

### Changed

- Plugin branding renamed to **RemNote Automation Bridge** with display name
  **Automation Bridge (MCP, OpenClaw...)**.
- Search default limit increased from 20 to 50.
- Search results are grouped by `remType` priority while preserving SDK ordering within each group.
- Journal default prefix is now empty; entries no longer include a leading space when no prefix is configured.

### Fixed

- Search results are deduplicated by `remId`.
- Circular-reference detection in rich-text resolution no longer produces false positives for repeated sibling
  references.
- `detail` extraction now falls back to inline card-delimiter content when `backText` is unavailable.

### Documentation

- Added and linked a canonical search/read output contract reference:
  - `docs/reference/remnote/bridge-search-read-contract.md`
- Consolidated developer guidance for local plugin execution and DevTools command workflows in `docs/guides/`.
- Updated `README.md` opening description to position the plugin as a generic/extensible external automation bridge
  (MCP server, CLI, and broader automation flows), not AI-assistant-only.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- Renamed plugin display name to **RemNote Bridge for MCP & OpenClaw** in `public/manifest.json`
- Updated in-plugin control panel title to **Bridge for MCP & OpenClaw** for naming consistency
