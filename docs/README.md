### Usage & Connection

- [Connection Lifecycle](guides/connection-lifecycle.md) — How the bridge connects after RemNote starts, what reconnect/backoff behavior looks like, and what each sidebar status means.
- [Bridge / Consumer Version Compatibility](guides/bridge-consumer-version-compatibility.md) — How to match bridge plugin versions with the `remnote-mcp-server` package during the `0.x` pre-stable period.

### Development
