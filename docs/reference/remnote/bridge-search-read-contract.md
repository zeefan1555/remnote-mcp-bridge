# Bridge Search/Read Contract

Purpose: define the behavior contract for `remnote_search`, `remnote_search_by_tag`, and `remnote_read_note` outputs
so future contributors and agents can reason about expected results without reverse-engineering adapter code.

This document describes output semantics, not implementation details.

## Why this exists

`remnote_search`, `remnote_search_by_tag`, and `remnote_read_note` are consumed by multiple clients (MCP server, CLI,
and AI tools). Small changes to field semantics can break downstream behavior even when code still compiles. This
contract keeps iterations safe and predictable.

## Output field semantics

### `title`

- `title` is the main/front representation of the Rem.
- It should be human-readable and preserve key inline formatting intent.
- It should resolve reference-like rich text where possible (for example Rem references/global names), rather than
  dropping content.

### `headline`

- `headline` is a display-oriented full line combining `title`, a type-aware delimiter, and internal secondary/back
  content when present.
- Format: `"title delimiter back-content"` (e.g. `"Term :: Definition"`, `"Question >> Answer"`).
- Delimiter selection: concept = `::`, descriptor = `;;`, all others = `>>`.
- When no secondary/back content exists, `headline` equals `title`.
- Present in both search and read outputs.

### `inlineRefs` (optional)

- `inlineRefs` lists direct inline Rem references found while rendering a Rem's `title`/`headline`.
- Each item has:
  - `text` — rendered target text used in output.
  - `targetRemId` — exact target Rem ID.
  - `kind` — currently `rem`.
- Omitted when the rendered Rem text contains no resolvable inline Rem references.
- Markdown rendering preserves inline Rem references as `[[Target Title]]`; use `inlineRefs` when consumers need exact
  graph traversal instead of parsing markdown.
- In `contentStructured`, each child node exposes its own `inlineRefs` when present.

### `media` (optional, read only)

- `read_note` returns `media` only when `includeMediaMetadata` is `true`.
- Items describe root-Rem images in deterministic field order: `text`, then `backText`, preserving rich-text order
  within each field.
- Each item includes a stable `mediaId`, `kind: "image"`, `field`, `elementIndex`, and `imageIndex`, plus available
  `imgId`, title, dimensions, MIME hint, and source metadata.
- Consumers must retrieve by `remId + field + mediaId`; array position alone is not an identity.
- The `get_media_locator` action re-reads the Rem and recomputes the ID. It rejects stale IDs,
  external URLs, and unsafe local tokens, and returns the owning `remId` plus a decoded, validated RemNote-managed
  filename token—not an absolute filesystem path or image bytes.

### `parentRemId` (optional)

- `parentRemId` is the Rem ID of the note's direct parent.
- Present in both search and read outputs when the note has a parent.
- Omitted for top-level Rems.

### `parentTitle` (optional)

- `parentTitle` is the rendered title/front text of the direct parent Rem.
- Present in both search and read outputs when the note has a parent.
- Omitted for top-level Rems.
- `parentTitle` is a single-hop parent label, not a full ancestry path.

### `ancestors` (optional)

- `ancestors` is a parent-first chain of nearby parent Rems.
- It is present only when the caller requests hierarchy context with `ancestorDepth > 0`.
- The current Rem is not included. The first item is the direct parent, the second item is the grandparent, and so on.
- Each item has at least `remId` and `title`; it may include `remType`.
- In `search_by_tag`, requested ancestors are available on both top-level results and `matchedRems`.

### `ancestorsTruncated` (optional)

- Present when the parent chain is deeper than the requested `ancestorDepth`.
- Use this as a signal to increase `ancestorDepth` or follow `parentRemId` manually when full hierarchy context matters.

### `aliases` (optional)

- `aliases` is an array of alternate names for the Rem, surfaced from `rem.getAliases()`.
- Omitted when no aliases exist.
- Present in both search and read outputs.

### `tags` (optional)

- `tags` is an array of direct tag identity objects applied to the returned Rem.
- Each item has `tagRemId` (exact tag Rem ID) and `name` (human-readable tag name).
- Omitted when no tags exist or when returned tag Rems cannot be resolved to both exact Rem ID and readable name.
- Present in both search and read outputs.
- In `search_by_tag`, `tags` belongs to the resolved target Rem that is returned, not necessarily the originally
  tagged descendant that caused the match.

### `remType`

- `remType` is required in both search and read outputs.
- `remType` is a primary agent-facing role, not a complete list of every RemNote trait. A Rem can be both a
  concept/card and a document.
- Current values:
  - `document`
  - `dailyDocument`
  - `concept`
  - `descriptor`
  - `portal`
  - `text`
- Classification order is `dailyDocument`, then `document`, then `concept`, `descriptor`, `portal`, and `text`.
  This means a concept/card that is also marked as a document is reported as `document`; card metadata remains exposed
  separately when available.
- Results may be grouped/sorted by this classification for retrieval quality.

### `cardDirection` (optional)

- Present only when flashcard practice direction is meaningful.
- Mapped values exposed to consumers:
  - `forward`
  - `reverse`
  - `bidirectional`
- Omit when SDK reports no direction (`none`) or when the Rem is not a flashcard.

### `content` (optional)

- Rendered markdown representation of the Rem's child subtree.
- Controlled by `contentMode` parameter:
  - `"none"` — omits `content` field entirely.
  - `"markdown"` — renders children as indented markdown with bullet prefixes and type-aware delimiters.
- Default: `"markdown"` for `readNote`, `"none"` for `search`.
- Rendering respects `depth`, `childLimit`, and `maxContentLength` parameters.
- Truncation occurs at line boundaries; incomplete lines are never included.

### `contentStructured` (optional)

- Structured child subtree for `remnote_search` and `remnote_read_note` results.
- Present when `contentMode` is `"structured"`.
- Value is an array of child nodes (not the root note itself), each with:
  - `remId`
  - `title`
  - `headline`
  - `remType`
  - optional `aliases`
  - optional `tags`
  - optional `cardDirection`
  - optional `children` (same shape recursively; omitted when empty)
- Rendering respects `depth` and `childLimit` parameters.
- `maxContentLength` does not apply to structured mode.
- Bridge omits RemNote powerup/property metadata children (for example aliases/property rows) from both structured and
  markdown content rendering to avoid redundant/internal noise in retrieval output.
- Bridge trims trailing empty leaf text nodes from rendered child lists (structured and markdown modes).

### `contentProperties` (optional)

- Present when `content` is rendered (i.e. `contentMode` is `"markdown"`).
- Fields:
  - `childrenRendered` — number of children included in the rendered content.
  - `childrenTotal` — total children in the subtree (capped at 2000 to avoid expensive counting).
  - `contentTruncated` — boolean indicating whether content was clipped by `maxContentLength`.

## Rich text rendering invariants

The adapter-level renderer should preserve meaning over exact visual fidelity:

- Resolve Rem references/global names to readable text when possible.
- Preserve resolvable inline Rem references as `[[Target Title]]` and expose their exact target Rem IDs through
  `inlineRefs`.
- Guard against true circular references while avoiding false positives for repeated sibling references.
- Surface non-text content with placeholders instead of silent loss (for example `[image]`, `[audio]`, `[drawing]`).
- Keep structural markers (for example card delimiter tokens) out of rendered `title` text.

## Search behavior contract

- Default search limit in bridge is 50 unless caller provides `limit`.
- Default `contentMode` for search is `"none"`.
- Search supports optional `parentRemId` to scope the search within a specific Rem's subtree (excluding the context Rem itself from results).
- Search `contentMode` modes: `"none" | "markdown" | "structured"`.
- Search supports `view: "compact" | "standard" | "full"` for metadata detail and `ancestorDepth` for parent-first
  ancestors.
- Default `depth` for search content rendering is 1.
- Default `childLimit` for search content rendering is 20.
- Default `maxContentLength` for search is 3000.
- Cursor paging:
  - responses include `hasMore`, optional `nextCursor`, `truncated`, and optional `truncationReason`;
  - passing `cursor` returns the next page from the same short-lived ordered snapshot;
  - cursors are query-bound and `parentRemId`-bound, and expire after bridge session inactivity;
  - the bridge retains at most 20 active search snapshots.
- Result ordering:
  1. grouped by `remType` priority (`document`/`concept` > `dailyDocument` > `portal` > `descriptor` > `text`)
  2. preserves SDK-provided intra-group ordering as relevance proxy
- Initial search captures an ordered snapshot of up to 1000 SDK results, deduplicates by `remId`, then returns the
  requested page size. Page content is rendered only for the current page.
- If the snapshot reaches the 1000-result cap, `truncated` is `true` with `truncationReason:
"cursor_snapshot_limit"`.
- Search may still return fewer results than requested due to SDK-side internal limits.

## Search-by-tag behavior contract

- `remnote_search_by_tag` accepts:
  - `tagRemId` (required)
  - `resultMode` (`"context" | "tagged"`, default: `"context"`)
  - `limit` (default: 50)
  - `cursor` (optional)
  - `contentMode` (`"none" | "markdown" | "structured"`, default: `"none"`)
  - `view` (`"compact" | "standard" | "full"`, default: `"standard"`)
  - `ancestorDepth` (default: `0`)
  - `depth` (default: 1)
  - `childLimit` (default: 20)
  - `maxContentLength` (default: 3000; markdown mode only)
- Tag lookup uses the exact tag Rem ID. Name, `#name`, and alias lookup are intentionally not used, so duplicate names,
  renamed tags, and aliases cannot change the target tag identity.
- If the exact `tagRemId` is valid input but does not resolve to a Rem, the result set is empty.
- For each tagged match, bridge resolves the returned result target as:
  1. nearest ancestor `document` / `dailyDocument` (preferred),
  2. otherwise nearest non-document ancestor,
  3. otherwise the tagged Rem itself (no ancestor case).
- In `context` mode:
  - output item fields and content rendering semantics match `remnote_search`;
  - results are deduplicated by resolved target `remId`;
  - each result includes `matchedRems` with the direct Rems carrying the requested tag that produced that context
    result.
- In `tagged` mode:
  - top-level results are the direct Rems carrying the requested tag;
  - each result includes `contextRemId`, `contextTitle`, and `contextReason` (`ancestor-document`,
    `ancestor-concept`, `ancestor-context`, or `self`).
- Cursor paging returns the same top-level paging metadata as `remnote_search`: `hasMore`, optional `nextCursor`,
  `truncated`, and optional `truncationReason`.
- Cursors are bound to `tagRemId` and `resultMode`; `context` and `tagged` cursors are not interchangeable.
- The bridge captures a short-lived ordered snapshot from up to 1000 direct tagged matches. Page content is rendered
  only for the current page.
- If the snapshot reaches the 1000-result cap, `truncated` is `true` with `truncationReason:
"cursor_snapshot_limit"`.
- `limit` applies to top-level results. In `context` mode, `matchedRems` contains direct matches observed for each
  returned context result while building the snapshot.
- Results are sorted with the same type-priority ordering as `remnote_search`, applied to the top-level result Rems.

## Read behavior contract

- Default `contentMode` for read is `"markdown"`.
- Read `contentMode` modes: `"none" | "markdown" | "structured"`.
- Read supports `view: "compact" | "standard" | "full"` for metadata detail and `ancestorDepth` for parent-first
  ancestors.
- Default `depth` for read is 5.
- Default `childLimit` for read is 100.
- Default `maxContentLength` for read is 100000.
- The `children` array and `NoteChild` type have been removed. Use `content` (markdown mode) or `contentStructured`
  (structured mode) instead.

## Breaking changes (from pre-0.6.0)

- `contentMode` changed from `boolean` to string enum (`search` and `read`: `'none' | 'markdown' | 'structured'`).
- `children` array removed from `readNote` response.
- `content` in `readNote` changed from echoing `title` to rendered markdown of child subtree.
- Default `depth` for `readNote` changed from 3 to 5.
- New required fields in output: `headline`.
- New optional fields in output: `aliases`, `contentProperties`.
- New optional fields in output: `tags`.
- New optional fields in output: `parentRemId`, `parentTitle`.
- `detail` field removed from `search` and `read_note` outputs; use `headline` for display-ready back-content rendering.

## Cross-repo compatibility notes

- MCP server should advertise these response fields in tool `outputSchema` so AI clients can plan tool usage correctly.
- MCP server should advertise `parentRemId` and `parentTitle` in search/read `outputSchema`.
- MCP server should advertise `ancestors` and `ancestorsTruncated` in search/read/tag-search `outputSchema`.
- MCP server should advertise `tags` as `{ tagRemId, name }` objects in search/read root items and structured child
  items.
- MCP server should keep `remnote_search_by_tag` output schema aligned with `remnote_search`.
- CLI text output may summarize/abbreviate some fields for readability; JSON output should preserve full bridge data.
